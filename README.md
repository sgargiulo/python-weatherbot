# Python Weatherbot

A Twitterbot for sending Dark Sky API responses to users via Twitter.

You'll need API keys for the Geocodio API and Dark Sky API. An .env-sample file has been provided for you -- you can just duplicate it and name it `.env`

You can sign up for a Dark Sky API key at https://darksky.net/dev/register. You can sign up for a geocodio API key at https://dash.geocod.io/register
